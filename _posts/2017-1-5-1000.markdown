## Summary
The 1000 Functional Connectomes Project and its International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) actively promote the formation of grassroots open data-sharing initiatives in the neuroimaging community. Examples include the classic 1000 Functional Connectomes Project dataset, the ADHD-200, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE), and coming soon – the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) and the Addiction Connectome Preprocessed Initative (ACPI).

HOW CAN YOU GET INVOLVED?

1. Suggest a new consortium – we welcome new grassroots consortium ideas and invite community members to consider becoming consortium leaders.
2. Suggest “common data elements” for future consortiums – we are actively working to find phenotypic data elements (i.e., measures, questionnaires) that can be promoted for usage in future consortiums
3. Share your data!
