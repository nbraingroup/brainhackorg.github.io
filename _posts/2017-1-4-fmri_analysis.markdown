# fMRI Analysis with CBRAIN

## Summary
CBRAIN is an open-source, web-based, distributed computing platform for collaborative neuroimaging. The CBRAIN service operated in Montreal is currently connected to nine national research High Performance Computing (HPC) centers in Canada, one in Korea, one in Germany, and several local research servers. As May 2015, CBRAIN was serving over 330 users spread across 50 cities in 17 countries.

In 2015, CBRAIN was released as an open-source product (https://github.com/aces/cbrain), enabling external contributions regarding the inclusion of new tools and features.
In this project, we will focus on the integration of fMRI tools in CBRAIN. Integrated tools will include FSL melodic, FSL feat, and any other relevant program proposed by Hackathon participants. Developments will cover core tool integration, viewers, and quality control.
