## Summary
NiftyView is a web-based application for viewing and analyzing medical images. Modern web browsers’ 3D graphical capability is used to improve the performance of the application for processing and rendering images. It doesn’t require any installation. To use it to view a NIFTI file, simply enter http://www2.hawaii.edu/~weiran/NiftyView.html in a web browser and drag the NIFTI file into the browser window. More features such as DICOM files and simple image processing will be included in the future. Feel free to email me if there’s a feature you would like to see in this application.
