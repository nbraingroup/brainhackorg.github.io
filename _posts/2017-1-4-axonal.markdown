## Summary
Implementation of random axonal growth to measure the connection length and simulate the growth.

This project is based on the paper from Sol Lims and Marcus Kaisers paper: “Developmental time windows for axon growth influence neuronal network topology” published in Biological cybernetics 109.2 (2015) on pages 275-286.

It simulates how the axons can growth and make up their connections.

The aim for this project is to deliver a fast and efficient solution, where other people may alter it for their research interests. Therefore it is written in Python.

The simulation decisions i made is more of a computer science view of how one can achieving some features.

So feel free to toy around and contact me if you have questions or find bugs or something else.

Thanks, Jan
