## Summary
The NIDASH Data Model (NI-DM) is a set of specifications ([http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/](http://nidm.nidash.org/specs/)) to convey neuroimaging  data and meta-data, developed by the INCF Neuroimaging Task Force  ([http://wiki.incf.org/mediawiki/index.php/Neuroimaging_Task_Force](http://wiki.incf.org/mediawiki/index.php/Neuroimaging_Task_Force)) (and the allied BIRN Derived Data Working Group: [https://wiki.birncommunity.org/display/FBIRN/Derived+Data+Working+Group](https://wiki.birncommunity.org/display/FBIRN/Derived+Data+Working+Group)).

The ultimate scope of NI-DM is all types of neuroimaging data, encompassing provenance from raw data to final statistical inference, but is presently focusing on fMRI and representation of the final statistical results. Export using the NI-DM is now implemented natively in SPM12b and available in FSL.

We would like to invite Hackathon participants to build applications using NI-DM. We will make available a set of fMRI experimental results exported using NI-DM. Possible applications include (but are not limited to):

1. Create ready-for-publication tables (PDF/HTML/RTF?) from peak data in NI-DM.
2. Create a machine-generated paragraph describing the model of each study, ready for inclusion in a manuscript, using the model information in NI-DM.
3. Create a conversion tool, exporting peak data for coordinate-based meta-analysis tools (such as GingerALE [http://www.brainmap.org/ale/](http://www.brainmap.org/ale/), MKDA [http://wagerlab.colorado.edu/files/tools/meta-analysis.html](http://wagerlab.colorado.edu/files/tools/meta-analysis.html), or SDM, [http://www.sdmproject.com/](http://www.sdmproject.com/))
4. Provide import of NI-DM in NeuroVault (cf. [http://brainhack.org/neurovault-org-ni-dm/](http://brainhack.org/neurovault-org-ni-dm/))
5. Create a viewer for NI-DM results.
