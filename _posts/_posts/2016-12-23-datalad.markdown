## Summary
Relying on git-annex, DataLad aims to establish a data distribution delivering variety of publicly available datasets (OpenfMRI collection, HCP, etc) via convenient unified, distributed and versioned interface. During hackathon we would be glad to work together to – help with refactoring “crawl”ing engine for automatic creation of git-annex repositories – place your datasets under git-annex control – develop custom git-annex external remotes to access data from interesting data providers/portals
