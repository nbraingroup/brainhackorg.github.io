## Summary
NeuroDebian provides a turnkey platform for bare metal or virtualized/cloud deployments. Possible hackathon projects could be: – packaging an interesting software for ultimate quick dissemination and integration with the largest software distribution (Debian) – enhancements to the neurodebian website, e.g. extraction of statistics (worldmap/timeline) for individual software packages/projects
