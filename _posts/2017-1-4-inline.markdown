## Summary
In collaboration with Siemens MR, we are developing a tool for “inline” monitoring of fMRI quality which will provide on-scanner feedback for typical artifacts encountered in an fMRI run (e.g. motion, ghosting). These results may quickly inform the operator whether a rerun is required. The project will be maintained on the Siemens IDEA user board, www.mr-idea.com, where the code and documentation will be available to research sites with IDEA access.
