## Summary
The 15 Minute DSI Project first began at the 2013 Hackathon in Paris, France. Siemens MR sponsored/attended the meeting and brought along a 15min DSI data set using the latest advanced in MR technology: MAGNETOM Prisma 3T scanner with 80 mT/m gradients, 64 channel head/neck coil and slice accelerated (3x) diffusion imaging. Here we would like to make the data set available to the neuroimaging community with the aim of providing a state of the art reference data set for advanced visualization techniques. Included is a half q-space 257 direction DSI with 2mm isotropic resolution acquired in under 15 minutes using Kawin Setsompop’s blipped CAIPI simultaneous multislice approach to slice acceleration. Also included is a standard 1mm isotropic MPRAGE scan.
